Moe:
  heredoc:
    signal handler for sigint done -> left is exit status fix on sig int it gives 1 instead of 130
    expand heredoc is working , left is norminette;
  yousef:
2- ensure clean error handling in execution
3- esnure clean error handling in env

general:
  1-ensure everything confroms to structure
  2-cleanup exec in general
  2-build cmd argv cleanup
  3-double check signals
  4-main cleanup
  4-norminette

edgecases:
<<1 | <<2 (no cmd heredoc)
