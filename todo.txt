-> expander:  
  : replace get_env with kittaneh's search_list;
  : norminette;

  -> payload_lexing:  
    : "|" is an arg not a pipe, token_list_lexing working but payload_lexing no
-> tokenizer:
  -norminette;


-> execution: 
  : README

  -> heredoc
    : prototype is ready, 
      : norminette;
      : left is a while loop for execution entry for each payload, and then execute our design on each payload, firt the heredoc
  -> buld_cmd_strcuture:  
      $U ls , should work , argv["", ls, -la , etc] , locate_cmd should handle it
  -> builtins:
    : for args we should not forget that if -na not correct
      : it will be considered an arg not an option

  ->  
  : what has been done: 
    : << 1 << 2 first thing gets segfault handled ;
    : heredoc expansion;



general edge cases : 
  : protections if user didnt enter delimiter, if user wrote << without anything , if and if and if u know the drill
